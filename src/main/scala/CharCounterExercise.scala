object CharCounterExercise {
  //TODO ask user to enter a sentence
  //TODO calculate and save character frequency into a Map
  //you can use mutable and/or immutable Map
  //print out this map with character frequencies
  //so your Map most likely will be of type [Char,Int]
  //also i think getOrElseUpdate method will be helpful
